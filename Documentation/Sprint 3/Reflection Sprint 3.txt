Greasy Games Sprint 3 Reflection:

Began the sprint realizing that our Sprint 2 was terrible and that major refactoring
was required. As a group, we slowly refactored for the first two weeks until our code
was close to where we wanted it be. Overall, our design is significantly better than
it was 3 weeks ago and such will 'hopefully' allow for future sprints to be much easier.
The changes from refactoring helped make implementing new pieces straight forward and
also made the group look through all of the code and quickly find what was terrible and
what was great. We also do a lot of reviews as we code and often work together to get
tasks done which helps with design and improves coupling and cohesion. Next sprint we
will be able to focus much less on refactoring and much more on implmenting new features
and meeting the sprint requiremnets. The group as a whole has been working excellent
together and everyone has done their part to get the code to where it needs to be.
