Specific comments on code quality
    Code quality is gorgeous. Everything makes sense and it is mostly self-documenting.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    Entity could contain a DrawOrder variable which would be helpful for drawing Player on top of Tiles (just as an example).
