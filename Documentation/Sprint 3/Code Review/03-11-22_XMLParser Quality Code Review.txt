Specific comments on code quality
	This class is very well written, I like the design of it a lot. The main function of this class is to return a list of objects being read in from the XML files and that creates a very easy way to add or remove things from the XML files and have the code still work, very well done. I also enjoy the comments left, it makes it much easier to follow.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	I do not think many things should be changed in here, as it was written in a future proof way, as mentioned before.
