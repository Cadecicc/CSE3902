Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	The code is a little bloated, but overall it is easy to follow. The GetCollisionResponse function is very clean and easy to read. The DetectCollision function is the main function that is a bit bloated, but it is easy enough to understand and read if you take your time through it. Overall I have no real problems with this class.
