Specific comments on code quality
    The code quality of Game1 is not great. There are a lot of foreach loops for different types when they could be
    condensed into one. Also, Player is only drawn on top because it is being iterated last which is not the way it
    should be handled.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    A hypothetical change would be to add a draw order to the IGoodDrawable enumerator. This would prevent having to
    iterate through each type of Entity individually in the Draw method.
