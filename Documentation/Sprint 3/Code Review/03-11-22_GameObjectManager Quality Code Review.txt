Specific comments on code quality
Potential code smell for having a list for all IEntities and then individual lists for each object that extend Entity
(which implements IEntity). 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change

A hypothetical change could be to get rid of all lists that extend Entity and leaving only list<IEntity>. Could easily 
become a problem since each list is actually being used absent the list of all IEntities.
