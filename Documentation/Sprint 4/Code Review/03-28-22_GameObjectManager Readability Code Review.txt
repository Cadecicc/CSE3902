Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
    Draw method has become more succinct while add and remove methods remain bloated. There are
	also copies of the add and remove methods that don't seem to have a purpose and an unused
	queue. The idea of the class is pretty clear but it seems like it hasn't been fully fleshed out
	in its implementation.
