Specific comments on code quality
    Nice, simple interface but missing a very important feature! A draw order is
	necessary to ensure that certain elements are drawn on the screen on top of others.
	This was easily added to the existing implementation.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    Let's say that we instead want to draw enemies on top of the player. This is easily
	implemented using the new DrawOrder field added to IGoodDrawable.
