Ideally:
1. Player position on map
2. Map populates as we explore dungeon
3. Health bar increases as player max health increases
4. if player takes damage health bar reflects this
5. pick up item, shows in inventory
6. highlight selected item
7. rupee count
8. key count
9. bomb count

Realistically:
1. Add items when pickup
2. health bar reflects player health
3. Rupee count - DNF
4. Bomb count - DNF
5. Both maps are automatically populated
6. Highlight selected item

Backlog:
1. Key count
2. Player position on map
