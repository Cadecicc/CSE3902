Greasy Games Sprint 4 Reflection:

We began the sprint pretty confident about who was doing what and did much less refactoring than we did for Sprint 3, though we still had to do some, in particular with creating an EntityManager singleton that cleaned up our code pretty effectively. Adding new features was the worst part for this sprint, specifically for adding UI elements and transitioning between rooms using a camera. We decided to only allow one player in our game to help us a bit with these things, which we all agreed was the best solution for our time table. We worked together and met a LOT for this sprint, which was very helpful to the whole team in understanding what the code was doing as a whole. For the last couple sprints, we segmented off parts so much that each member of the group had little to no idea as to what other parts that they did not write were doing. Overall, this sprint went well and we feel as if we all worked together efficiently and everybody did their part that they were assigned, as well as helping each other out when people got stuck. Our game is really coming together and we are all pretty confident at the moment with where we are at.
