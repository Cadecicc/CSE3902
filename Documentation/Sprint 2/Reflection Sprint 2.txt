Greasy Games Sprint 2 Reflection:

Our team did a great of job of charging head first into the sprint. Our design process
began almost immediately, but this is where things began to fall apart. Since our
collective design skills are lacking, we quickly found these decisions to be replaced
by other ones on the fly. Our team soon became disorganized and our communication
started to fall apart. Towards the end of the sprint, it seemed like, as we became more
acquainted with each other, our communications improved and we were working better
together. Going forward, we would like to establish more concrete roles within the
team (such as project manager, lead programmer, and lead designer) and create a rigid
plan at the start of each sprint with design decisions that we will stick to. All in
all, we managed to get through it but there's much room for improvement!
