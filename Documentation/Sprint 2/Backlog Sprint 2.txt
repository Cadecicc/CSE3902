Sprint 2 Incompletes:

We did not complete the ICollideable interface by the end the sprint, did not seem necessary to the goals of the sprint.

Enemy movements are completely different, each movement for enemy's needs to be unique

Lacking a proper inventory system

Major refractors needed/underway

Need more factories for instantiating objects like enemies and tiles.
