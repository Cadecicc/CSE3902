Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
    AnimatorFactory.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:

Specific comments on code quality:
    The AnimatorFactory class correctly realized the factory pattern but was becoming
	monolithic and needed desperately to be refactored.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the
current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
    Adding more objects that require animators will become much easier to maintain, as
	AnimatorFactory is now responsible for redirecting an object to a more specific
	animator factory (so if an NPC needs an animator, then the AnimatorFactory will
	pass the request along to the NPCAnimatorFactory).
