Author of the code review:

Date of the code review:
    02/19/2022

Sprint number:
    Sprint 2 

Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
    IdlePlayerState.cs 

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
    Luke L.

Specific comments on code quality:
    The code quality is clean and simple with only one issue. There is a coupling issue in the Enter() and Exit() methods with Entity calling three subclasses.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
    This class can be deleted if the player movement state can handle when the player is not moving. The current implementation can handle this change.
