Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
Layout is great. Contructor is easy to follow but use of magic numbers in "Damageable(1d, 2)" is not easily understood. Initialize, Draw, and Update are easy to follow.
Overall, could use comments to help strcuture code flow but calls are ewasily readable.
