Sprint number:
	Sprint 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
	Level1Controller.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
	Luke L.

Specific comments on code quality:
	Code quality is very clean and simple. The class stands to be more data driven, but overall 		
	the class functions well and is not bogged down by unnecessary code, as well as being 
	decoupled from the rest of the code very well.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	The enemy creation and change should be handled in its own controller, but for now this 
	implementation works well as we could not figure out another way to handle this effectively 
	and cleanly before the Sprint is due. This change would be difficult to implement so whether 
	or not it is worth it to change is to be determined.
