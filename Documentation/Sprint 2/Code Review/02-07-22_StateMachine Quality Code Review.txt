Sprint number:
    Sprint 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
    StateMachine.cs (and player states)

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
    Luke L.

Specific comments on code quality:
    A little bit of redundancy in player states was removed by migrating IController
	into StateMachine and calling CheckInputs() in the Update method of the player
	class.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the
current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
    Adding more states will become easier as each one will have a state machine
	handling all of the updates for them through the main controller.
