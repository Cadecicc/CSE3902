Sprint number:
    Sprint 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
    KeyboardController.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
    Dylan C.

Specific comments on code quality:
    Code quality is good. The class is data driven, which is really nice. Made the CheckInputs() method virtual to allow for behaviour extension. Fixed a null reference error.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
    If we want a controller that takes input using not only the keyboard but also other conditions, this is easily supported by the change.
