Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
Constrcutors are very easily understood as variables names are consistent and meaningful. Draw lacks readability as there are many parameters, as well as lengthy parameters in themselves "new Vector2(parent.Position.X, -parent.Position.Y)." Triming this method to only send relevant data rather than sending magic numbers with no contextual meaning.
