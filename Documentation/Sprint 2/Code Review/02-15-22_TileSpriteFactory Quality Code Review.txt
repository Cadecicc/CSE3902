Specific comments on code quality
Code is good as case allows for easy implimentation of added tile types. Lots of magic numbers, including the "scale" for the new Sprite() creation.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
Add support for changing tilempa rather than hardcoding the name for future change of levels. Introduce a scale variable for use in the return statement.
