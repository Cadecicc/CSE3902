Specific comments on code quality
    The clean is well organized and has a methodical structure to it. There is quite a bit of parallelism going on
    that I think could be reduced with data structures.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    Let's say, hypothetically, that we wanted to introduce additional game states (i.e. hi-score game state). Based
    on the current implementation of this class, we would need to introduce another data structure and an accessor
    method for it. If we doubled the amount of game states, the amount of code in the class doubles.
