Code is exceptional in that it is well-organized, with nearly every method being 1-2 lines in total. It seems to perform the job of a singleton very well.

A hypothetical game change would be a variable volume setting to increase or decrease global or specific game sounds' volumes. This code could easily support that change in my mind.
