Specific comments on code quality
Easy read and is clear the application of the different varaibles. Well written and the different shooting types are clerar in their distinct purpose.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
There are a couple of magic numbers that are wihtin the class. Would like to see them not there but the time says otherwise.
