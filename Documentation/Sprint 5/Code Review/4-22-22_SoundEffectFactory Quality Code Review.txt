Specific comments on code quality
The quality is exceptional and minimal for this managers implementation to have helper factories for entities and songs.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
A hypothetical change could be to seperate the song factory from SoundManager and SoundEffect factory. This could easily be implemented but also serves to
be unnecessary.
