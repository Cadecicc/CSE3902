Greasy Games Sprint 5 Reflection:

Greasy Games started off Sprint 5 with a bang. They formed a strong, cohesive plan with clear specifications and
immediately began implementing new features. Communication was great among the team and everyone stepped up to
contribute their fair share. In hindsight, the code was a complete mess. Dozens of conditional statements led to
complex logic and unreadable code. That being said, the work that the team put in during the previous sprints led
to a strong code foundation that they were easily able to screw up and have a lot of fun with. Everyone on the team
is satisfied with the work they have accomplished, not only during this sprint but the entire semester.
